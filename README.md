## Readings
* [Beginner's book + code](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/)
* [More in depth book](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-84858-7)

## Resources
* [Late Days Google Form](https://forms.gle/M9WPuLp5HdM74m5v8)
* [Twitch Stream](twitch.tv/chelseaparlett)
* [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/): a shareable online jupyter notebook. Like google docs for code (but instead of being able to see changes live, you can only see other people's changes when you save and re-open notebook). Great for collabing with other people, or for storing your code online.
* [OBS Streamlabs](https://streamlabs.com/): Great for recording your presentation.
* [Slack](): A place to ask me questions, meet with other students, share fun data sets...etc.
* HP Smart [Apple](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hp-easy-scan/id967004861?mt=12) [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hp.printercontrol&hl=en_US): An app that will let you "scan" things to PDF using the camera on your phone/tablet. Great for sending me signed documents, or other important files. 

## Zoom Ettiquite
* Mute your microphone when you're not speaking
* Set your avatar/profile image to be a picture of you, or a bitmoji of you (it really helps make it feel like we're not talking to an empty room!)
* Wear appropriate clothing if turning on camera (camera not required during class sessions)
