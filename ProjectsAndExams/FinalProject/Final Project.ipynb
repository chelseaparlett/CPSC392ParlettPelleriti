Come up with at **least 7 questions** that you want to answer based on the variables (at the top of this document, provide a short description of each of the variables in the model).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These questions can be about the relationships between variables, or how well one thing can predict another, clustering...etc, but note that in your final project you must use at least 1 prediction model, 1 clustering model, and 1 instance of dimensionality reduction, so keep that in mind when creating questions. You will be graded on the quality of the questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "$^{[0]}$ Note that dimensionality reduction includes Regularization which we will not cover until the Monday after this is due. However, I suggest that you watch the lecture early to see whether you can incorperate it. The lecture is up now. You can also change your questions in response to my and your peers' feedback in #4.\n",

    "### **3.**\n",
    "\n",
    "(**25 points**; Due Tuesday December 1st at 11:59pm; PDF) Now put on your data scientist hat. Write an **ORGANIZED analysis plan** to answer **3** of the questions you came up with. Think about which of the questions need a predictive model, which need a clustering model, which need dimensionality reduction, and which maybe need just visualizations/summaries.\n",

    "(**10 points**; Due Tuesday December 15th at 11:59pm; Video link) Prepare a short presentation of the results (powerpoint, prezi, keynote...etc).

    "3. A **PDF** with your analysis plan.\n",
    "4. A **text submission or PDF** on Canvas with your critique of *another* students plan.\n",
    "5. A **PDF** of your python notebooks. Please get rid of extra analyses/code that you did not end up using. You must clearly indicate where each question is being answered. Also include a **README**.\n",
    "6. A **link** to a short video presentation (do not send the video directly). \n",

    "    <li> For Part I, #4 You should write your critiques separately.\n",
    "    <li> For Part II, #5 You should work on it together (I suggest using Google Colab, it's like Google Docs for Jupyter notebooks, but without live updating$^{[1]}$), and EACH submit a copy of the notebook PDF. <b>You must ALSO submit a joined statement (as a PDF) describing what each member did. Each of you should submit a copy of this.</b>\n",
    "    <li> For Part II, #6 You each need to make your OWN video presenting on 3 of the questions each, however you can collaborate on the presentation materials (the slides..etc). Each of you should submit a separate video.\n",
    "    <li> For Part II #7 You need to each do separate peer reviews.\n",
