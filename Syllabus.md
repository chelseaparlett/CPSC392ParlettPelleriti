## Program Learning Outcomes
The Chapman experience creates outcomes which are consistent with our identity. Similar to the General Education program, each degree program, or major, at Chapman has a unique set of learning outcomes, or student abilities that are not only related to Chapman's institutional mission and goals, but also unique to the student's discipline or field of study. For more information, [Fowler School of Engineering Program Learning Outcomes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OESCtPUolnWFV_qRFuRzNrzxmUtYr5H-dFaYVmPUKY0/edit?usp=sharing).

## General Education Learning Outcomes
Students create sophisticated arguments supported by quantitative evidence and can clearly communicate those arguments in a variety of formats (using words, tables, graphs, mathematical equations, etc., as appropriate).

## Overview
This course provides a survey of algorithms, tools, and techniques for computing with Big Data.  Students will be exposed to fundamental concepts in data mining, machine learning, and information retrieval systems, with special emphasis on techniques for data visualization and analysis.  Recent advances in high performance computing, such as map-reduce, will be presented in the context of Big Data.  Students will apply data mining algorithms to data sets from biology, chemistry, social media, and industry using several popular machine learning packages.


## Prerequisites:
CPSC 230.

## Units:
CPSC 392 is a 3 unit course.

## Required Text:
NONE.

##  Course materials:
All course materials will be made available via Blackboard and/or Github

## Homework, Exams, and Grading (subject to change):
Homework will consist of assignments to reinforce material covered in class, and must be submitted electronically. They will typically be due at the beginning of class (assignments not due on a class day will be due by 11:59pm), and may be demonstrated to the instructor during the class session.

Stuff happens. So, you have 3 "extra days" that you can use, no questions asked, throughout the semester for any homework or project (NOT Quizzes and Tests). You must use 1 whole extra day at a time (i.e. you cannot use 3 hours of an extra day for one assignment, and 21 on another). To qualify for an extra day, you must let me know BEFORE the assignment is due. Because of these 3 "extra days", late homework will NOT be accepted.

All programs must be written in Python unless otherwise specified. Grading will be based on correctness, elegance of solution, and style (comments, naming conventions, etc.)

There will be occasional quizzes on the lecture material and classwork, which will count toward the Quizzes grade. Missed quizzes may NOT be made up. However, I will drop your lowest 2 quiz scores at the end of the semester, so use these 2 dropped quizzes to account for sick days or missed classes.

There will also be  two in-class exams and take home projects and a final exam and take home project, which must be taken on the dates specified. *I don't believe taking tests while sick demonstrates your true ability, so in the case of a well-documented, unavoidable conflict or illness, I will do my best to accommodate you. You must notify me prior to missing the exam.*

## Collaboration Policy:
You have much to learn from your classmates, and so I encourage you to discuss and study course material together. However, all work you submit for this course must be your own, and must be completed individually unless otherwise specified. More specifically, you may not present source code or programs copied from the Internet, other texts, other students, etc as your own work. Of course, you are free to use whatever reference materials you like, but please cite them in a README turned in with your assignments. I assume you are familiar with Chapman’s policy on academic misconduct is presented below and any incidents of academic misconduct or dishonesty will be dealt with severely in accordance with this policy.

## Chapman University’s Academic Integrity Policy:
Chapman University is a community of scholars that emphasizes the mutual  responsibility of all members to seek knowledge honestly and in good faith. Students are responsible for doing their own work and academic dishonesty of any kind will be subject to sanction by the instructor/administrator and referral to the university Academic Integrity Committee, which may impose additional sanctions including expulsion. Please see the full description of Chapman University's policy on Academic Integrity at www.chapman.edu/academics/academicintegrity/index.aspx.

## Chapman University’s Students with Disabilities Policy:
In compliance with ADA guidelines, students who have any condition, either permanent or temporary, that might affect their ability to perform in this class are encouraged to contact the Office of Disability Services. If you will need to utilize your approved accommodations in this class, please follow the proper notification procedure for informing your professor(s). This notification process must occur more than a week before any accommodation can be utilized. Please contact Disability Services at (714) 516-4520 or (www.chapman.edu/students/student-health-services/disability-services ) if you have questions regarding this procedure, or for information and to make an appointment to discuss and/or request potential accommodations based on documentation of your disability. Once formal approval of your need for an accommodation has been granted, you are encouraged to talk with your professor(s) about your accommodation options. The granting of any accommodation will not be retroactive and cannot jeopardize the academic standards or integrity of the course.

## Chapman University’s Equity and Diversity Policy
Chapman University is committed to ensuring equality and valuing diversity.  Students and professors are reminded to show respect at all times as outlined in Chapman’s [Harassment and Discrimination Policy](http://www.chapman.edu/faculty-staff/human-resources/eoo.aspx).  Please review the full description of Harassment and Discrimination Policy.  Any violations of this policy should be discussed with the professor, the Dean of Students and/or otherwise reported in accordance with this policy.”


## Student Support at Chapman:
Over the course of the semester, you may experience a range of challenges that interfere with your learning, such as problems with friend, family, and or significant other relationships; substance use; concerns about personal adequacy; feeling overwhelmed; or feeling sad or anxious without knowing why. These mental health concerns or stressful events may diminish your academic performance and/or reduce your ability to participate in daily activities. You can learn more about the resources available through Chapman University’s Student Psychological Counseling Services here:
https://www.chapman.edu/students/health-and-safety/psychological-counseling/

Fostering a community of care that supports the success of students is essential to the values of Chapman University.  Occasionally, you may come across a student whose personal behavior concerns or worries you, either for the student’s well-being or yours.  In these instances, you are encouraged to contact the [Chapman University Student Concern Intervention Team](https://www.chapman.edu/students/health-and-safety/student-concern/index.aspx) who can respond to these concerns and offer assistance. While it is preferred that you include your contact information so this team can follow up with you, you can submit a report anonymously.  24-hour emergency help is also available through Public Safety at 714-997-6763.

## Religious Accommodation
Religious Accommodation at Chapman University Consistent with our commitment of creating an academic community that is respectful of and welcoming to persons of differing backgrounds, we believe that every reasonable effort should be made to allow members of the university community to fulfill their obligations to the university without jeopardizing the fulfillment of their sincerely held religious obligations. Please review the syllabus early in the semester and consult with your faculty member promptly regarding any possible conflicts with major religious holidays, being as specific as possible regarding when those holidays are scheduled in advance and where those holidays constitute the fulfillment of your sincerely held religious beliefs.

## Changes
This syllabus is subject to change. Updates will be posted on the course website.

## Fowler School of Engineering
### Fall 2020 – Addendum to Course Syllabi
Due to the continuing COVID-19 Pandemic, the following items are in effect for courses offered by the Fowler School of Engineering, in addition to the policies and procedures detailed in individual course syllabi.

## Video Recording of Courses
Software will be used to record live class discussions as needed to support course learning objectives. As a student in these courses, your participation in live class discussions will be recorded to assist those who cannot attend the live session, or to serve as a resource for those who would like to review content that was presented.  These recordings will be made available only to students who are enrolled in the class, and only during the period in which the course is offered.  All recordings will become unavailable to students in the class shortly after the course ends.  Students who prefer to participate via audio only will be allowed to disable their video camera so only audio will be captured. Please discuss this option with your instructor.

## Remote Instruction
Courses in the Fowler School of Engineering are designed to be highly flexible in order to allow students to complete requirements remotely and asynchronously, if needed. If you need to complete the course asynchronously, you should contact the instructor prior to the first week of class;
Students will need to have a stable internet connection and computing platform to complete course requirements. A headset with microphone is highly recommended;
Policies for remote attendance will be included in course syllabi. Please direct any questions or concerns to your instructor during the first week of class;
Course instructors retain the autonomy to use whatever technologies they feel are appropriate to proctor examinations or assessments taken remotely. This includes requiring students to complete exams on camera using Zoom, etc;
All office hours and small group meetings between students and faculty will be conducted remotely via Zoom, Teams, or other methods; details are included in course-specific syllabi;
Course format may be subject to change with little to no notice, depending upon state, local, and University guidelines. If the course shifts to on-campus instruction, students will be able to complete course requirements remotely should they need to do so.
Safety Protocols for on-campus instruction

In response to the current COVID-19 pandemic, Chapman University has developed the CU Safely Back program (CUSBP) and mandatory safety measures (https://news.chapman.edu/coronavirus/). The University’s mandatory safety measures may be stricter than local, state or federal guidelines and may be subject to change at any time. Students are expected to adhere to the University’s safety measures while attending classes, including when entering and exiting classrooms, laboratories, or other instructional areas. Individual faculty may choose to have requirements for their courses that are stricter than the University’s. Safety precautions and procedures may change in response to emerging findings and the recommendations of scientific experts and authorities. Refusal to abide by the University’s mandatory safety measures or to the safety requirements specific to this course will result in your being asked to leave the area immediately, and may result in an administrative dismissal from this course.

The COVID-19 pandemic requires all of us to accept the possibility that changes in how this course is taught may be required and that some changes may occur with little or no notice. For example, some or all of the in-person aspects of a course may be shifted to remote instruction. If this occurs, you will be given clear instructions as to how to proceed. The uncertainty of the situation is not ideal for any of us.  We must all try to approach this situation with good-will, flexibility, and mutual understanding.
