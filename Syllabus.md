## Program Learning Outcomes
The Chapman experience creates outcomes which are consistent with our identity. Similar to the General Education program, each degree program, or major, at Chapman has a unique set of learning outcomes, or student abilities that are not only related to Chapman's institutional mission and goals, but also unique to the student's discipline or field of study. For more information, [Fowler School of Engineering Program Learning Outcomes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OESCtPUolnWFV_qRFuRzNrzxmUtYr5H-dFaYVmPUKY0/edit?usp=sharing).

## General Education Learning Outcomes
Students create sophisticated arguments supported by quantitative evidence and can clearly communicate those arguments in a variety of formats (using words, tables, graphs, mathematical equations, etc., as appropriate).

## Overview
This course provides a survey of algorithms, tools, and techniques for computing with Big Data.  Students will be exposed to fundamental concepts in data mining, machine learning, and information retrieval systems, with special emphasis on techniques for data visualization and analysis.  Recent advances in high performance computing, such as map-reduce, will be presented in the context of Big Data.  Students will apply data mining algorithms to data sets from biology, chemistry, social media, and industry using several popular machine learning packages.


## Prerequisites:
CPSC 230, and MATH 203 OR MGSC 209.

## Units:
CPSC 392 is a 3 unit course.

## Required Text:
NONE. Optional Reading is linked on the Front Page of the Course GitHub.

##  Course materials:
All course materials will be made available via Canvas and/or Github

## Homework, Exams, and Grading (subject to change):
Homework will consist of assignments to reinforce material covered in class, and must be submitted electronically. They will typically be due at 11:59pm (unless otherwise specified). Homework and Projects must be turned in with a README file as either a .txt or a .md file (see Admin Folder on GitHub for a template).

### Late Days
Stuff happens. So, you have 3 "extra days" that you can use, no questions asked, throughout the semester for any homework or project (NOT Quizzes and Tests). You must use 1 whole extra day at a time (i.e. you cannot use 3 hours of an extra day for one assignment, and 21 on another). If an assignment was due Monday at 11:59pm and you use 1 late day, the assignment would then be due Tuesday at 11:59pm.

To qualify for an extra day, you must let me know *BEFORE the assignment is due*, and fill out the **Late Days Google Form** linked on the front page of our course GitHub under Resources. Because of these "extra days", late work will automatically be penalized a 1% per hour (or part of an hour) late. Because of grading deadlines, extra days CANNOT be used during finals week and may not prevent peer feedback during the final project.

### Assignments
All programs must be written in Python unless otherwise specified. Grading will be based on correctness, clarity, elegance of solution, and style (comments, naming conventions, etc.)

### Assessment Structure
There will be weekly quizzes on the lecture material and classwork, which will count toward the Quizzes grade. Missed quizzes may NOT be made up. However, I will drop your lowest 2 quiz scores at the end of the semester, so use these 2 dropped quizzes to account for sick days or missed classes.

There will also be two in-class exams, two corresponding take home projects. In-class exams must be taken on the dates specified. *I don't believe taking tests while sick demonstrates your true ability, so in the case of a well-documented, unavoidable conflict or illness, I will do my best to accommodate you. You must notify me prior to missing the exam.*

Finally there will NOT be a final exam, rather there will be a final project and presentation.

## Course Communication
Information for the course will mainly be disseminated through our Course Slack. YOU MUST join the course slack channel and check for updates. Email through Canvas may also be used. Materials will also be available through the course GitHub (https://github.com/cmparlettpelleriti/CPSC392ParlettPelleriti).

## Collaboration Policy:
You have much to learn from your classmates, and so I encourage you to discuss and study course material together. However, all work you submit for this course must be your own, and must be completed individually unless otherwise specified. More specifically, you may not present source code or programs copied from the Internet, other texts, other students, etc as your own work. Of course, you are free to use whatever reference materials you like, but please cite them in a README turned in with your assignments. I assume you are familiar with Chapman’s policy on academic misconduct is presented below and any incidents of academic misconduct or dishonesty will be dealt with severely in accordance with this policy.

## Chapman University’s Academic Integrity Policy:
Chapman University is a community of scholars that emphasizes the mutual  responsibility of all members to seek knowledge honestly and in good faith. Students are responsible for doing their own work and academic dishonesty of any kind will be subject to sanction by the instructor/administrator and referral to the university Academic Integrity Committee, which may impose additional sanctions including expulsion. Please see the full description of Chapman University's policy on Academic Integrity at www.chapman.edu/academics/academicintegrity/index.aspx.

## Chapman University’s Students with Disabilities Policy:
In compliance with ADA guidelines, students who have any condition, either permanent or temporary, that might affect their ability to perform in this class are encouraged to contact the Office of Disability Services. If you will need to utilize your approved accommodations in this class, please follow the proper notification procedure for informing your professor(s). This notification process must occur more than a week before any accommodation can be utilized. Please contact Disability Services at (714) 516-4520 or (www.chapman.edu/students/student-health-services/disability-services ) if you have questions regarding this procedure, or for information and to make an appointment to discuss and/or request potential accommodations based on documentation of your disability. Once formal approval of your need for an accommodation has been granted, you are encouraged to talk with your professor(s) about your accommodation options. The granting of any accommodation will not be retroactive and cannot jeopardize the academic standards or integrity of the course.

## Chapman University’s Equity and Diversity Policy
Chapman University is committed to ensuring equality and valuing diversity.  Students and professors are reminded to show respect at all times as outlined in Chapman’s [Harassment and Discrimination Policy](http://www.chapman.edu/faculty-staff/human-resources/eoo.aspx).  Please review the full description of Harassment and Discrimination Policy.  Any violations of this policy should be discussed with the professor, the Dean of Students and/or otherwise reported in accordance with this policy.”


## Student Support at Chapman:
Over the course of the semester, you may experience a range of challenges that interfere with your learning, such as problems with friend, family, and or significant other relationships; substance use; concerns about personal adequacy; feeling overwhelmed; or feeling sad or anxious without knowing why. These mental health concerns or stressful events may diminish your academic performance and/or reduce your ability to participate in daily activities. You can learn more about the resources available through Chapman University’s Student Psychological Counseling Services here:

## Religious Accommodation
Religious Accommodation at Chapman University Consistent with our commitment of creating an academic community that is respectful of and welcoming to persons of differing backgrounds, we believe that every reasonable effort should be made to allow members of the university community to fulfill their obligations to the university without jeopardizing the fulfillment of their sincerely held religious obligations. Please review the syllabus early in the semester and consult with your faculty member promptly regarding any possible conflicts with major religious holidays, being as specific as possible regarding when those holidays are scheduled in advance and where those holidays constitute the fulfillment of your sincerely held religious beliefs. When dates of holidays are known in advance, you must notify me at least 7 days ahead of the necessary accommodation in order for us to plan together accordingly.

## Changes
This syllabus is subject to change. Updates will be posted on the course website.

## Fowler School of Engineering
### Spring 2022-- Addendum to Course Syllabi
Due to the continuing COVID-19 Pandemic, the following items are in effect for courses offered by the Fowler School of Engineering, in addition to the policies and procedures detailed in individual course syllabi.

## Video Recording of Courses
Software *may* be used to record live class discussions as needed to support course learning objectives. As a student in these courses, your participation in live class discussions may be recorded to assist those who cannot attend the live session, or to serve as a resource for those who would like to review content that was presented.  These recordings will be made available only to students who are enrolled in the class, and only during the period in which the course is offered.  All recordings will become unavailable to students in the class shortly after the course ends.  Students who prefer to participate via audio only will be allowed to disable their video camera so only audio will be captured. Please discuss this option with your instructor.

The COVID-19 pandemic requires all of us to accept the possibility that changes in how this course is taught may be required and that some changes may occur with little or no notice. For example, some or all of the in-person aspects of a course may be shifted to remote instruction. If this occurs, you will be given clear instructions as to how to proceed. The uncertainty of the situation is not ideal for any of us.  We must all try to approach this situation with good-will, flexibility, and mutual understanding.

Students must follow current guidelines from Chapman University regarding COVID 19. See [here](https://cusafelyback.chapman.edu/). As per the Student Conduct Code: "Any activity that interferes with the normal operation of the University or infringes on the safety of other members of the University community including obstructing an academic class or lecture, administrative support function or university event […] Engaging in classroom conduct prohibited by the faculty member or in violation of law or University policy is also prohibited."
