    "Hierarchical clustering (as the name suggests) assumes that the clusters in the data have a hierarchical relationship. For example, in a McDonald's food dataset we could have clusters like: Dessert, Drinks, Sandwhiches, Other. Within Sandwhiches we could have chicken sandwhiches, Burgers, Vegan Sandwhiches...within Burgers we could have smaller, lower calorie options, and bigger, more substantial burgers...etc.\n",

    "* **distance metric**: this is a measure that helps us define how close together two *data points* are.
