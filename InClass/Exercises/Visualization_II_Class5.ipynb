Draw on your own experiences (and your friends/family's experiences). For example, if you have a rare type of colorblindness, you might come up with the question \"Is my palette readable by someone with tritanomaly colorblindness?\". Think about visual impairments, cultural/group contex that not everyone shares, language barriers...etc. We'll share these with the class."
