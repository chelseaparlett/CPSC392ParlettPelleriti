    "### 0.1 Naive\n",
    "Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm which assumes (incorrectly) that within a group/class, the probability of a combination of predictor values (like $P(diabetic, obese, smoker)$) is equal to the product of the individual predictor probabilities. In other words, it assumes that they are *independent* and that knowing someone is a smoker does *not* affect the probability of being diabetic. In mathematical terms, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(D,O,S) = P(D) * P(O) * P(S)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In real life we know that this independence is very unlikely (hence: *naive*). But it turns out that this inapproporiate assumption doesn't usually have a huge effect on the accuracy of the model, and it saves a LOT of computational time because we can simply calculate independent probabilities and multiply them, rather than calculating complex conditional probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.2 Bayes\n",
    "The Bayes part of the Naive Bayes algorithm refers to the fact that we calculate \"scores\" that measure how likely a data point is to belong to some class, $C$. These \"scores\" are proportional to the probability of a data point belonging to class $C$. Once we have a \"score\" for each possible category, we choose whichever category has the highest score. \n",
    "\n",
    "The \"score\" is based on Bayes' Theory which says:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(category | data) \\underbrace{\\propto}_\\text{is proportional to} \\underbrace{P(Data | Category)}_{\\text{How common this combination of predictors is for that Category}^1} * \\underbrace{P(Category)}_\\text{How common that category is in the dataset}$$\n",

    "### 0.3 NB in sklearn\n",
    "In sklearn there are 3 main functions you can use to perform Naive Bayes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `GaussianNB()`: Assumes that features follow a Normal/Gaussian Distribution.\n",
    "* `BernoulliNB()`: Assumes features are binary (0/1)\n",
    "* `CategoricalNB()`: Assumes features are discrete categories (can have more than 2 categories)\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that if your features are continuous you'd use `GaussianNB()`, if they are only binary, use `BernoulliNB()` and if they are only Categorical, use `CategoricalNB()`. In practice, we'll often use either `GaussianNB()` or `CategoricalNB()` (since `CategoricalNB()` can also handle it when we have binary + categorical).\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that computationally, we cannot have both continuous + categorical predictors in one sklearn NB model. (There are workarounds for this: see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14254203/mixing-categorial-and-continuous-data-in-naive-bayes-classifier-using-scikit-lea), but for now, we'll be using only one or the other).\n",

For each outcome category (own-`1`, not own-`0`) calculate the probability of having a `1` in each of the predictor categories (having an income > 100k, being over 40, having kids, and having more than one income).\n",
