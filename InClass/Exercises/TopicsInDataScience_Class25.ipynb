    "# 1. The Ensemble\n",
    "A common theme in applied Machine Learning is *The Ensemble Method*. Ensemble methods use multiple machine learning models (these models can be the same type or different algorithms entirely). The idea is that using ensembles improves predictive performance, because even though our models are sometimes incorrect, it's unlikely that a MAJORITY of the models in our ensemble will all be incorrect in the exact same way each time. Therefore in aggregate, we will get a more accurate model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each model gets a \"vote\" about what category a data point should be in (ensemble methods also work for continuous outcomes, but here we'll focus on categorical ones). Whichever category gets the most \"votes\" is the category we choose for that data point. \n",
    "\n",
    "To combat overfitting and reduce potential *over-reliance* on a small number of features, we can use the two following techniques when creating models for our ensemble:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)**: Instead of using all of our training data to train each model in our sample we use **bootstrapping** to choose the samples we will include.\n",
    "    * **Bootstrapping** is when you randomly sample data points *with replacement*, meaning that a data point can be included in your bootstrapped sample *more* than once, OR not at all.\n",
    "* **Random Feature Selection**: Instead of using all the available features/predictors in our dataset for every model, for each model we randomly choose a different subset of features to use when training. This helps our ensemble generalize, because it doesn't become overly reliant on one feature (since that feature might not appear in every model).\n",
    "\n",
    "While ensemble methods take a lot of computational power (you're training MANY models instead of just one), in practice they're often really useful. An incredibly popular ensemble method is the **Random Forest** which is an ensemble method that uses a bunch of decision trees along with Bagging and Random Feature selection to generate the ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Building a Random Forest\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's build a tiny random forest function of our own! The `Forest()` that takes in 5 arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `n_samples` (**integer**): number of bootstrapped samples to use to train each decision tree.\n",
    "* `n_features` (**integer**): number of randomly selected features from your data set to use when training.\n",
    "* `n_trees` (**integer**): how many decision trees to create for the ensemble.\n",
    "* `X` (**data frame**): the *already* z-scored predictor data to be used.\n",
    "* `y` (**data frame**): the outcome data to be used (`X` and `y` are the same length, and the $i^{th}$ element of `X` corresponds to the $i^{th}$ element of `y`)\n",
    "\n",
    "The function should:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. (DONE FOR YOU) use a for loop to create `n_trees` models and store them in a list called `forest` (yes! You can store fitted decision trees in a list!)\n",
    "2. (DONE FOR YOU) For each model you should choose use bootstrapping to sample `n_samples` data points to train each model. Remember that boostrapping means sampling WITH replacement (hint: try using [`np.random.choice`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.choice.html) to randomly select (*with replacement*) which row numbers/indices to use.\n",
    "3. (DONE FOR YOU) For each model, randomly select `n_features` to use to train your model. (hint: try using [`np.random.choice`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.choice.html) to randomly select (*withOUT replacement*) which predictor indices to use.\n",
    "4. For each model, train the model (no need to use model validation, and assume X is already z-scored).\n",
    "5. (DONE FOR YOU) Return a list (`forest`) of dictonaries that look like this (where `tree` is your trained model and `samples_index` is an array of indices for the features/predictors you selected):\n",
